          Getting into the entrepreneurial world is a risky adventure full of
          difficulties, especially for young entrepreneurs lacking technical
          skills, business intelligence and funds. Therefore, highlighting its
          motto&nbsp;
          <strong>&quot;Advancing Technology For Humanity&quot;</strong>, IEEE
          R8 organization launched a very promising initiative known as the IEEE
          R8 Entrepreneurship Initiative, aiming at strengthening the knowledge
          of young entrepreneurs and exposing them to the IEEE wide network. In
          order to reach this goal, IEEE R8 is relying on its very unique and
          strong entrepreneurship ecosystem consisting of a variety of technical
          foundations and organizational units. The IEEE R8 entrepreneurship
          initiative was the best chance for us as youth to make a change and
          that’s why we decided to organize the&nbsp;
          <strong>
            “Tunisia Entrepreneurship Summit: Industry innovation and
            Infrastructure (3I) ”
          </strong>
          &nbsp; It will be a two-day summit which encompasses various panel
          sessions, workshops and mentorship for the future entrepreneurs about
          the technical and soft skills needed to build a business and to make
          their ideas get developed and see the light, and also a pitch
          competition for teams with innovation, startups and small business
          owners.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.writing}>
          The event will be held in the entrepreneurship week along with other
          similar event(s) from this initiative since we believe that we need to
          cover all the Tunisian territory and we want the participants to have
          various themes for the competition. There will be 3 winners from the
          competition who will be selected to participate in the YP summit to
          pitch their ideas.
