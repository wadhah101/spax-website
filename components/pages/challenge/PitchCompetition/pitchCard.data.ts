	"The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) refers to interconnected sensors, instruments, and other devices networked together with computer's industrial applications, including manufacturing and energy management. This connectivity allows for data collection, exchange, and analysis, potentially facilitating improvements in productivity and efficiency as well as other economic benefits. The IIoT is an evolution of a distributed control system (DCS) that allows for a higher degree of automation by using cloud computing to refine and optimize the process controls. To increase the efficiency and ensure the security of the industrial enterprise’s data, IOT is highly applied in the manufacturing world since the 4th industrial revolution. We are witnessing an era in which we can command of a production line via a click on a button. We are highlighting the interconnection of devices across the factory floor and enabling the automated transfer of manufacturing data to a common location, and potentially up to the cloud, for future analysis. The IIoT is enabled by technologies such as cybersecurity, cloud computing, edge computing, mobile technologies, machine-to-machine, 3D printing, advanced robotics, big data, internet of things, RFID technology, and cognitive computing. Five of the most important ones are described below:"

	"Return on investment (ROI) is a ratio between net profit (over a period) and cost of investment (resulting from an investment of some resources at a point in time). A high ROI means the investment's gains compare favorably to its cost. As a performance measure, ROI is used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment or to compare the efficiencies of several different investments. In economic terms, it is one way of relating profits to capital invested. Any manufacturer would be happy to ensure that he will get a beneficial return on his investment. The ROI can be increased in several ways:"
